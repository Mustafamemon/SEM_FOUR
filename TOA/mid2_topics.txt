Dear Students,

Try to be expert in the following topics for the upcoming MID-II exam. For achieving maximum marks, don't rely ONLY on the questions we did during the classes.

- Kleene's Theorem
- Complement of Regular languages and FAs
- Properties of regular languages
- DFA Minimization
- Pumping Lemma
- Mealy and  Moore Machines
- CFGs

Best of Luck.
